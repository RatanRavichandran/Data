* No facial paralysis observed.
* Stenon’s duct orifice was free on intraoral examination.
5. Imaging & Diagnostic Tests
* Ultrasound
   * Revealed a 20 mm, well-circumscribed, hypoechoic, and vascularized mass in the superficial lobe of the right parotid gland.
* Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
   * T1-weighted: Hyposignal lesion with homogeneous enhancement after gadolinium injection.
   * T2-weighted: Slight hypersignal mass in the superficial portion of the right parotid gland.
   * Diffusion-weighted: Notable hypersignal with an apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of 1.36.
   * Overall impression consistent with a benign tumor.
6. Clinical Impression / Working Diagnosis
* Imaging suggested a benign salivary gland tumor, likely a pleomorphic adenoma or similar benign lesion.
7. Treatment & Intraoperative Findings
* Procedure: Superficial parotidectomy with complete tumor excision and preservation of the facial nerve.
* Intraoperative Frozen Section: Non-contributory (no definitive diagnosis).
* Postoperative Course: No complications; facial nerve function intact.
8. Histopathology / Final Diagnosis
* Microscopic Findings
   * Well-limited benign proliferation of large polygonal cells (oncocytes) with eosinophilic and granular cytoplasm, surrounded by a thin fibrous capsule.
   * No necrosis, no mitotic activity.
* Conclusion: Parotid oncocytoma (benign tumor).
9. Outcome & Follow-Up
* No recurrence observed after 3 years of follow-up.
* No mention of additional treatment (radiotherapy/chemotherapy) since oncocytoma is benign and slow-growing.
10. Additional Notes / Commentary
* Oncocytomas are rare salivary gland tumors, accounting for less than 1% of all salivary gland neoplasms.
* In this case, imaging (particularly MRI) and final histopathology confirmed the diagnosis.
* Long-term follow-up is recommended due to rare reports of malignant transformation or recurrence if excision is incomplete.

5. Imaging & Diagnostic Tests
* Panoramic Radiograph:
   * No abnormalities detected.
* Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):
   * Revealed a large (6.1 × 2.3 × 4.9 cm), well-defined, lobulated, heterogeneous lesion.
   * The lesion involved the left upper gingivo-buccal sulcus, left retromolar region, and extended into bilateral pterygoid muscles; superior extension into the infratemporal fossa with infiltration of the infratemporal fat, bowing of the posterolateral wall of the left maxillary sinus, and lateral abutment against the masseter muscle.
   * On T1-weighted images: Hypointense lesion.
   * On T2-weighted images: Hyperintense lesion.
* Ultrasonography:
   * Showed a hypoechoic area in the left parotid gland.
* Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC):
   * Demonstrated an admixture of epithelial, myoepithelial, and mesenchymal tissue elements.
6. Clinical Impression / Differential Diagnosis
* Provisional Diagnosis: Benign parotid gland tumor.
* Differential Diagnoses Considered:
   * Pleomorphic adenoma (most likely)
   * Warthin's tumor
   * Neuroma of the facial nerve (nerve sheath tumor)
* Rationale:
   * The slow, asymptomatic progression, imaging characteristics, and FNAC findings pointed toward a benign neoplasm, with pleomorphic adenoma being the most common and fitting the clinical picture.
7. Treatment & Intraoperative Findings
* Surgical Approach:
   * Excision of the superior lobe of the left parotid gland along with the tumor mass via a modified Blair incision in the left preauricular region.
* Operative Details:
   * Dissection included careful separation of the platysma and superficial musculoaponeurotic layer (SMAS).
   * Identification and preservation of facial nerve branches using a retrograde approach.
   * The tumor was separated from both the facial nerve and the masseter muscle.
* Gross Specimen:
   * Dimensions: 8 × 10 × 12 cm
   * Weight: Approximately 1.8 kilograms
* Intraoperative Course:
   * No complications reported; preservation of facial nerve function confirmed.
8. Histopathology / Final Diagnosis
* Microscopic Findings:
   * A well-capsulated, highly cellular mass composed of sheets and islands of epithelial and myoepithelial cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm.
   * Presence of mucoid (myxomatous) background material with chondroid and ductal differentiation, along with areas containing fat and osteoid.
* Differential Considerations on Histology:
   * Pleomorphic adenoma, myoepithelioma, and adenoid cystic carcinoma.
* Definitive Diagnosis:
   * The characteristic chondromyxoid foci and glanduloductal differentiation confirmed the diagnosis of pleomorphic adenoma of the left parotid gland.
9. Outcome & Follow-Up
* The patient was followed up for 3 years postoperatively with no signs of recurrence or complications.
10. Additional Notes / Commentary
* Imaging and FNAC:
   * MRI and ultrasonography played key roles in delineating the lesion’s extent and characteristics. FNAC provided supportive cytological evidence.
* Surgical Considerations:
   * Emphasis was placed on the preservation of the facial nerve during the resection due to the tumor’s proximity to nerve branches.
* Literature Context:
   * Pleomorphic adenoma is the most common salivary gland neoplasm, frequently seen in the parotid gland, and is characterized by its mixed epithelial and mesenchymal features.
* Clinical Importance:
   * Early diagnosis and complete excision are crucial given the tumor’s potential for recurrence and the risk (albeit low) of malignant transformation if inadequately managed.

   * Intraoperative frozen section consultation reported findings consistent with adenocarcinoma with a poorly differentiated component.
8. Histopathology / Final Diagnosis
* Microscopic Findings:
   * The resected tumor exhibited two distinct components:
      * Carcinomatous Component:
         * Adenoid cystic carcinoma with predominant tubular and cribriform growth patterns and focal solid areas.
         * Notable perineural invasion was observed.
      * Sarcomatous Component:
         * High-grade spindle cell neoplasm featuring occasional giant cells, scattered mitoses, and extensive necrosis.
         * Areas showing chondroid (cartilaginous) differentiation consistent with chondrosarcoma.
* Immunohistochemistry Profile:
   * Adenoid Cystic Component:
      * Positive for epithelial markers: CAM 5.2, CD117, p63, SMMH, p40, CK7, pancytokeratin AE1/AE3, and GATA-3.
   * Sarcomatous Component:
      * Negative for epithelial markers but strongly positive for vimentin.
      * S-100 positivity highlighted focal chondroid differentiation.
      * High Ki-67 proliferation index (50–70%) in the sarcomatous areas.
* Final Diagnosis:
   * Carcinosarcoma of the parotid gland, composed of an adenoid cystic carcinoma (carcinomatous element) and chondrosarcoma (sarcomatous element).
   * No evidence of a pre-existing pleomorphic adenoma was identified.
9. Outcome & Follow-Up
* Postoperative Management:
   * The patient is currently receiving radiotherapy targeted at the tumor bed and skull base, addressing the high propensity for perineural invasion by the adenoid cystic component.
* Lymph Node Status:
   * Selective neck dissection revealed negative lymph nodes for metastatic carcinoma.
10. Additional Notes / Commentary
* Tumor Characteristics:
   * Carcinosarcoma is an extremely rare and aggressive malignancy, accounting for 0.04–0.16% of all salivary gland tumors.
   * The biphasic nature (distinct carcinomatous and sarcomatous components) underscores its aggressive clinical course and poor prognosis.
* Prognostic Considerations:
   * These tumors exhibit high rates of distant metastasis (up to 54% in some studies) and generally have a poor long-term survival rate.
* Literature Context:
   * This case is notable as it represents the first reported instance of a carcinosarcoma of the parotid gland with an adenoid cystic carcinoma component combined with chondrosarcoma.
* Clinical Implications:
   * Aggressive treatment, including radical surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy, is indicated due to the tumor’s high-grade nature and aggressive behavior.
* Future Considerations:
   * Further studies are warranted to better understand the tumorigenesis and optimal management strategies for this rare entity.

   * Patient Identifier/Initials: Not provided (case anonymized)
   * Age: 62 years old
   * Sex: Male
   * Ethnicity: Not specified
   * Institution/Location: Shanxi Medical University / First Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China
2. Chief Complaint / Reason for Referral
   * Painless mass in the left preauricular region present for more than two months.
3. Relevant Medical History
   * Past Medical/Surgical History:
   * No previous history of a mass in the parotid or neck region.
   * No documented systemic illnesses or previous head and neck malignancies.
4. Physical Examination Findings
   * Local Findings:
   * Palpable mass in the left parotid gland, approximately 3 cm × 2 cm × 2 cm in size.
   * Mass is hard, fixed to surrounding tissues, non-tender, and associated with adherence to adjacent structures.
   * No facial paralysis initially noted; however, intraoperative findings later indicated possible involvement of the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve.
   * Regional Findings:
   * Multiple enlarged cervical lymph nodes were palpated.
5. Imaging & Diagnostic Tests
   * Enhanced Computed Tomography (CT):
   * Demonstrated a soft tissue shadow adjacent to the left masseter muscle, involving both the masseter and parotid gland, suggestive of a malignant lesion of salivary gland origin.
   * Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):
   * Revealed abnormal signals in the left masseter muscle and parotid gland.
   * Findings raised the possibility of an infectious process with abscess formation, though malignancy remained in the differential.
   * Fine-Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC):
   * Initial cytology showed inflammatory cell infiltration, multinucleated cell aggregates, and small foci of moderate heterogeneous epithelial hyperplasia.
   * Immunohistochemical results:
   * CK8/18: Negative
   * p63: Positive
   * Ki67: Approximately 20% positivity
   * S100, SMA, CD163, SOX: Negative
   * AB/PAS special stain: Negative
   * Preliminary interpretation favored a diagnosis of lymphadenitis over a neoplasm.
6. Clinical Impression / Differential Diagnosis
   * Preoperative Impression:
   * Initial consideration was lymphadenitis, with tumor possibility remaining under investigation due to inconclusive FNAC.
   * Final Diagnostic Considerations:
   * Primary squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the parotid gland was suspected after intraoperative findings and subsequent frozen section analysis.
   * Differential diagnoses included metastatic SCC (ruled out by thorough workup) and high-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma (excluded by PAS-negative staining).
7. Treatment & Intraoperative Findings
   * Surgical Intervention:
   * The patient underwent resection of the parotid tumor under general anesthesia.
   * Initial intraoperative frozen section (from the left parotid mass) suggested an inflammatory lesion.
   * Due to evolving intraoperative findings, the surgical plan was modified:
   * Resection of the parotid tumor with dissection of the facial nerve (FN) was performed.
   * A second intraoperative frozen section confirmed a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma.
   * An extended resection of the malignant tumor along with supraglottic lymphadenectomy was subsequently carried out.
   * Intraoperative Findings:
   * The tumor was located in the deep lobe of the parotid gland, with no clear peripheral capsule and an unclear boundary.
   * The tumor exhibited a hard texture and poor mobility, with tight adherence to the marginal mandibular branch of the FN.
   * Intraoperative frozen analysis of the lymph nodes showed no metastatic carcinoma.
8. Histopathology / Final Diagnosis
   * Permanent Section Findings:
   * Moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the parotid gland.
   * Immunohistochemistry Results:
   * CK: Positive
   * CK7: Negative
   * p40: Positive
   * p63: Positive
   * p53: Mutant pattern (positive)
   * Ki67: Approximately 40% positivity
   * Final Diagnosis:
   * Primary squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the parotid gland.
   * Notes on Diagnosis:
   * The absence of other primary SCC lesions in the head, neck, or distant sites (metastatic workup) supported the diagnosis of a primary parotid SCC.
   * The diagnosis was challenging due to initial false-negative FNAC findings and overlapping features with inflammatory processes.
9. Outcome & Follow-Up
   * Postoperative Management:
   * The patient was advised to undergo postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy (ART) approximately one month after surgery.
   * Due to personal reasons, ART was postponed.
   * Current Status:
   * On follow-up, the patient exhibits signs of facial nerve involvement (facial paralysis of the left lower lip and altered left frontal line).
   * No signs of local recurrence have been reported so far.
   * Long-Term Considerations:
   * Close and lifetime monitoring is recommended due to the aggressive nature of primary parotid SCC and its high risk of recurrence and distant metastasis.
10. Additional Notes / Commentary
   * Epidemiology & Prognosis:
   * Primary parotid SCC is rare, accounting for 0.1–3.4% of all parotid tumors.
   * The disease is typically aggressive with a dismal prognosis despite multimodal treatment.
   * Diagnostic Challenges:
   * FNAC has limited sensitivity for malignant parotid tumors, often yielding false-negative results due to sampling issues, necrosis, or inflammatory masking.
   * Intraoperative frozen sections play a crucial role in guiding surgical management.
   * Treatment Implications:
   * Extended resection and selective neck dissection are recommended.
   * Postoperative ART is critical to decrease the risk of locoregional recurrence, though its impact on overall survival remains debatable.
   * Clinical Awareness:
   * A high index of suspicion is necessary even for asymptomatic individuals to avoid misdiagnosis, especially given the complex presentation and variable pathologic findings in primary parotid SCC.

9. Outcome & Follow-Up
   * Postoperative Management:
   * Adjuvant post-operative radiation therapy applied (60 Gy, delivered as 2 Gy twice a day, five days a week) to the surgical bed and right neck area due to the aggressive nature of the tumor.
   * Pathological Staging:
   * pT4pN2pM0.
   * Follow-Up:
   * At three years post-treatment, the patient remains free of tumor recurrence.
10. Additional Notes / Commentary
   * Tumor Characteristics:
   * SDC is a rare, aggressive malignancy that histologically resembles ductal carcinoma of the breast.
   * High propensity for early cervical lymph node involvement and distant metastasis (commonly to the lungs and bones) is noted.
   * Therapeutic Considerations:
   * In advanced cases, targeted therapies with anti-HER-2 monoclonal antibodies (e.g., trastuzumab) may be beneficial.
   * The immunohistochemical profile (HER-2 positive; ER and PR negative) aids in distinguishing SDC from breast ductal carcinoma.
   * Prognosis:
   * SDC typically has a poor prognosis with high rates of locoregional recurrence and distant metastases. Radical surgical resection combined with adjuvant radiotherapy is the current standard of care.
   * Literature Context:
   * This case underscores the importance of comprehensive pathological and immunohistochemical analysis to guide treatment and improve diagnostic accuracy in rare salivary gland malignancies.
