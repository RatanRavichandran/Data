Patient Information:
• Patient ID: [Anonymized]
• Age: 50 years
• Sex: Female


Tests Ordered:
1. Complete Blood Count (CBC)
2. Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP)
3. Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC) – Salivary Gland Evaluation


Results:


1. Complete Blood Count (CBC):
   • White Blood Cells: 6.8 x10³/µL (Reference: 4.0–10.0)
   • Hemoglobin: 13.2 g/dL (Reference: 12.0–15.5)
   • Platelets: 250 x10³/µL (Reference: 150–400)
   • Red Blood Cells and other parameters are within normal limits.


2. Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP):
   • Sodium: 138 mmol/L (Reference: 135–145)
   • Potassium: 4.2 mmol/L (Reference: 3.5–5.0)
   • Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL (Reference: 0.6–1.2)
   • Glucose: 90 mg/dL (Reference: 70–100)
   • Other metabolic values are unremarkable.


3. Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC) – Salivary Gland Lesion:
   • Specimen Quality: Moderately cellular with a mix of cohesive cell clusters and dispersed elements.
   • Cytological Findings: 
       - Epithelial cells arranged in clusters with a moderate amount of myxoid background.
       - No significant atypia, mitotic figures, or necrosis observed.
   • Interpretation: Cytomorphologic features are consistent with a benign salivary gland process. The findings support a benign neoplastic lesion; however, correlation with imaging and clinical findings is recommended for a definitive diagnosis.


Conclusion:
The CBC and BMP are within normal ranges, indicating no systemic abnormalities. The FNAC specimen demonstrates features of a benign salivary gland lesion. Although the cytological evaluation suggests a benign process, further radiological correlation is advised to fully assess the lesion’s characteristics and extent.
