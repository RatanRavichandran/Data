Current Clinical Presentation
• Chief Complaint:
 – Reports noticing a subtle, gradually enlarging swelling in the left facial region near the ear over the past five months
– The area appears slightly asymmetrical on the left side compared to the right, first observed during a routine dental exam
• Associated Symptoms:
 – The swelling is painless and not associated with any numbness or facial weakness
– Occasional mild discomfort during chewing but no significant impact on daily function
– No systemic symptoms such as fever, weight loss, or night sweats
Examination and Initial Investigations
• Physical Examination:
 – Inspection reveals a modest fullness in the left preauricular area
– On palpation, the mass is firm yet mobile, with no overlying skin changes
– Facial nerve function appears intact during routine testing
• Laboratory Work-Up:
 – Recent complete blood count (CBC) and basic metabolic panel (BMP) are within normal limits
• Imaging and Diagnostic Studies:
 – Ultrasound examination of the head and neck shows a well-circumscribed, hypoechoic lesion located in the region of a major salivary gland
– A fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) was performed; the sample revealed clusters of epithelial cells in a benign-appearing myxoid background, suggestive of a non-aggressive process
– Further radiological correlation (with modalities such as MRI) has been recommended to better define the lesion’s characteristics and extent
Additional Notes and Considerations
• General Health:
 – Overall, the patient’s chronic conditions are well-managed; she maintains a good level of physical and mental health despite occasional tension headaches and fatigue, likely linked to work-related stress
• Lifestyle Impact:
 – Her active lifestyle, regular exercise, and balanced diet contribute positively to her general well-being
– No known exposure to significant environmental toxins or occupational hazards
• Follow-Up:
 – The patient is scheduled for a detailed evaluation by a specialist in head and neck disorders to further assess the nature of the lesion
– Ongoing monitoring and additional imaging studies are planned to ensure a comprehensive review of all findings
